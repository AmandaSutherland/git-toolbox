I looked into rebasing a bunch because I had never worked with it before. 

Rebasing allows you go between branches and choose how you want to merge various branches.
It also gives you the ability to edit your commits - you can change the messages so they
either are a mixture of several messages or just get change what you wanted to say, or you
can squash several together so you don't have so many small commits.
